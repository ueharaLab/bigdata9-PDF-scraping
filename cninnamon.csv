44,3,Spice story 
45,3,"From 1600 BCE, ancient Egyptians used a type of cinnamon for incense and as an embalming spice, importing it from Asia via African traders. It is not known for certain whether this was cinnamon from Sri Lanka or Chinese cassia. From the 8th century CE, Arab merchants dominated the trade and invented tall tales to protect their sources and high prices. In one such myth, giant birds were said to gather the bark from an unknown land, using it to make nests on high cliffs, and the only way to collect it was to lure the birds away with large pieces of meat. The real source remained a mystery to Europeans until the Portuguese found cinnamon trees growing in Sri Lanka in the early 1500s, and promptly occupied the island. They in turn were ousted by the Dutch, who then fought the British for centuries over control of the territory and lucrative trade. "

108,5,"Cassia was used for medicinal purposes in ancient China from 2700 bce, and was among the first spices to reach the Mediterranean via the ancient trade routes. The Egyptians used cinnamon as a culinary spice and for its health properties, but it is unclear whether they used cinnamon or cassia. Persians knew cassia and cinnamon as darchini, and used them in savoury and sweet dishes. By the 5th century bce, cassia had been identified as distinct from cinnamon. Medieval English and French cookbooks referred to cassia and cinnamon as ÅgcanellaÅh, but cassiaÅfs coarser flavour saw its status demoted: in his 15th-century book of manners, Bok of Nurture, John Russell wrote that ÅgSynamone is for lords, canelle for common peopleÅh. Today, cassia accounts for nearly 50 per cent of the worldÅfs cinnamon supply, and is a key spice in China and Southeast Asia. It is popular in North America, where most Ågground cinnamonÅh is actually cassia. "

Courtiers addressing the Emperor during the Chinese Hang dynasty (206 bCE220 CE) used cloves to sweeten their breath, and the Romans, who named the spice clavus (Latin for nail), used it as an incense and perfume. In the Middle Ages, clove took off as a culinary spice in the West. At first the Republic of Venice had a virtual monopoly of the lucrative trade, but the Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and English fought a series of wars to seize control, with the Dutch eventually winning out. In the 18th century, Frenchman Pierre Poivre managed to smuggle clove seedlings to Mauritius. "

330,11,Spice story 
331,11,"Records show ancient Egyptians using anise as a cure for snake bites, but it was the Romans who really developed a fondness for its intensely sweet, liquorice-like taste, drawing on anise to flavour everything from the provisions of a lowly centurion to the spiced wine conditum and rich cake mustaceoe served at special banquets. Anise endured as a popular kitchen garden plant into the Middle Ages, especially in the Pyrenees, where monks produced an anise-flavoured liqueur that the French drank as an aperitif and also added to stews and stocks. Today, several liqueurs are still flavoured with aniseÅfs essential oil, including French pastis, Greek ouzo, Turkish raki, and Arab arrak. Anise has also long been regarded as an effective aid to digestion; in India today the fruits are commonly chewed whole after meals. "
